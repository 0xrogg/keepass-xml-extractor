# KeePass XML Extractor

**KeePass XML Extractor** is a simple Python script to parse KeePass database exports (in XML format) and extract credentials (titles, usernames, passwords, and URLs). It also saves the extracted data to a CSV file for easier analysis or reuse.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Parses KeePass XML exports
- Extracts:
  - Entry title
  - Username
  - Password
  - URL
- Outputs results to terminal
- Saves results to a CSV file (`extracted_credentials.csv`)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

### 1. **Export your KeePass database as XML**

From **KeePassXC** or **KeePass**, go to:
``File → Export → KeePass XML (unencrypted)``  
Save it as `keepass_export.xml`.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** The XML file contains passwords in plaintext. Handle with care.

---

### 2. **Run the script**

```bash
python3 keepass_xml_extractor.py
````

If your XML file has a different name or location, modify the `xml_file` variable at the bottom of the script.

---

### 3. **Output**

* Extracted credentials are printed in a clean format.
* A CSV file `extracted_credentials.csv` is generated in the current directory.

---

## 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.x

No additional dependencies are required — only Python’s built-in libraries (`xml`, `csv`, `collections`).
